Public Spaces: Hotels have increased the frequency of cleaning and disinfecting in public spaces, with a focus on the counter at the front desk, elevators and elevator buttons, door handles, public bathrooms and even room keys.
Back of House: In the spaces where associates work “behind the scenes,” hotels are increasing the frequency of cleaning and focusing on high-touch areas like associate entrances, locker rooms, laundry rooms and staff offices.

5 of 5 stars review on TripAdvisor - 16 Jun 2023
I come here quite often for day use. This time Asher in the reception served me and gave me the room before 10am as I told him I am pregnant and he showed a gentleman gesture towards me. Jasneet helped me with my bag and Asher helped my disabled husband with his wheelchair. We met the owner as well during our stay he smiled at us and opened the door to help us. Asher and Jasneet gave us best experience so far. I really wish them best in their lives!

"A Short History of Paddington Station Next to Mercure London Paddington Hotel
Paddington Station is one of the most iconic and historic railway stations in London. It has been serving passengers and goods since 1838, and has witnessed many changes and developments over the years. In this blog post, we will explore the history of Paddington Station, from when it was built and the first underground line in London, to the latest addition of the Elizabeth line.
Paddington Station was originally a temporary terminus for the Great Western Railway (GWR), which was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel to connect London with Bristol and the West Country. The temporary station opened on 4 June 1838, along with the new line that reached as far as Maidenhead. The permanent station was built between 1851 and 1854, and featured a stunning three-span iron and glass roof that covered 13 platforms. The station building on platform 1 had three oriel windows that overlooked the train shed, and a royal waiting room for Queen Victoria.
Paddington Station was also the first station in London to be served by the London Underground, the world's first underground railway. In 1863, the Metropolitan Railway opened its line from Paddington to Farringdon Street, using steam locomotives. Later, other lines were added, such as the District Railway in 1868, the Bakerloo Railway in 1913, and the Hammersmith & City Railway in 1926. Today, Paddington Station has two separate tube stations that provide connections to the Bakerloo, Circle, District, and Hammersmith & City lines.
Paddington Station underwent several expansions and improvements in the 20th century, as traffic and population increased. In 1913-1916, a fourth span was added to cover platforms 9 to 16. In 1933-1935, a new entrance building was constructed on Praed Street. In 1968-1970, a new concourse was built on The Lawn area between platforms 8 and 9. In 1998-2000, a new terminal was opened for Heathrow Express services to Heathrow Airport.
Paddington Station is also famous for being the arrival point of Paddington Bear, a fictional character created by Michael Bond in 1958. Paddington Bear is a friendly bear from Peru who wears a blue duffle coat and a red hat. He was found at Paddington Station by the Brown family with a label around his neck that read ""Please look after this bear. Thank you."" Since then, he has become one of the most beloved children's characters in Britain and around the world.
Paddington Station is now ready for the future, as it is one of the main stations for the Elizabeth line, a new railway that connects east and west London. The Elizabeth line runs from Reading and Heathrow Airport in the west to Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the east. It offers faster and more frequent services to central London and beyond. The Elizabeth line opened in May 2022.
If you're looking for a place to stay in London near Paddington Station, you can't go wrong with Mercure London Paddington.

"The best Winter walks in and around London
If you’re visiting London over the next couple of months but still would like to explore the beauty of the City and the surrounding areas then we have just what you’re looking for. Below we are going to tell you some of the best places to go for Winter walks in and around London, all we’ll say is don’t forget the thermals if you’re planning on the longer treks.
Whether you prefer a walk that feels like you’re in the middle of nowhere in one of the eight Royal Parks, enjoy a ramble around Greenwich Park or hiking around Hampstead Heath there are plenty of green spaces for you to enjoy walking in and around the City of London in winter.
Below we list five of our favourite Winter walks in London that we would recommend to anyone visiting the City with some time on their hands and who enjoys being one with nature.
Kensington Gardens
When we think about a ‘peaceful’ walk right in the heart of the City we are immediately transported to the stunning Kensington Gardens. The wide open spaces and woodland areas are perfect for a winter stroll with bountiful spots of awe for passers-by to enjoy and ramblers will also be able to enjoy landmarks like the Albert Memorial, the Serpentine and Kensington Palace to name a few.
Victoria Park
Spanning over two hundred acres, Victoria Park is known as one of the City’s favourite open spaces and it’s not surprising as to why. The park is encompassed within Tower Hamlets and is a glorious green space during a crisp winter day when a fresh frost has set. Definitely worth investigating for an easier stroll with a wide-open feel.
Richmond Park
If you hop on the District Line from Paddington Station it will take you all the way to Richmond, from here it’s a short walk or bus journey (depending which entrance you’d like to enter) to the gates of Richmond Park. This park is the largest of the eight Royal Parks spanning a total two thousand five hundred acres. The Royal Parks are home to over four thousand species of animal and more than half of them can be found here, the most common of which is fallow deer which can be spotted roaming freely in the parks and dense woodland. You could spend a full day in this park and not even scratch the surface of this immense area.
Regent’s Park
For a more picturesque experience you need look no further than Regent’s Park, with it’s gorgeous tree-lined pathways, gorgeous lakes and smart gardens. You’ll feel immersed in a story book. If you head deep within the park and find the canal you may even be able to spot some of the residents at ZSL London Zoo!
Walthamstow Wetlands
Just a short walk away from Tottenham Hale station on the Victoria Line lies the most impressive Walthamstow Wetlands. Home to both flora and fauna alike the Walthamstow Wetlands is Europe’s largest urban wetlands. There are plenty of quiet spots to be found and for any ornithologists out there we recommend taking some binoculars as there are a few choice bird-watching spots on your way around.

"Royal Shakespeare Company presents The Tempest
In January 2023, The Royal Shakespeare Company will be bringing you it’s riveting performance of The Tempest. Running at The Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford-Upon-Avon you will be able to witness this outstanding performance from Thursday 26th January until Saturday 4th March 2023.
The RSC have been running productions of the classic Shakespeare play from as early as 1951 which have featured several famous faces depicting the role of Prospero including Ian Richardson, Alec McCowen and Patrick Stewart to name a few.
The Tempest, originally written in around 1610 – 1611 is a multi-levelled tale, it follows a mother and daughter and their fight for survival on an island entrenched in unknown sounds and awe-inspiring sights. Then on one fateful morning, an enemy long forgotten sail into view changing everything.
There is turmoil in the world, political unrest is ripe and unsettled climates make for uncertain times. Family and sibling rivalries are paramount causing people to be weary of their own loved ones. The world at large is full of tension.
On an island full of strange sounds and wondrous sights, a mother and daughter struggle to survive.
Then one day, their long-lost enemies sail into view on the horizon. Surrounded by a tumultuous sea, the reunited foes are forced to confront their pasts and themselves.
The Tempest is written to encourage the audience to inspect the balance in our own personal relationships, as well as the fragile ecosystems around us. Whilst looking inward it aims to get the viewer to ask key questions; what damage do we do to our fellow human – and in turn nature? The end result of The Tempests is that love ultimately brings hope for a life better lived and suggesting that maybe healing ourselves whilst fixing the planet could be considered one in the same.
Alex Kingston returns to the RSC to play Prospero in Shakespeare’s elemental tale of survival and forgiveness. Elizabeth Freestone makes her Royal Shakespeare Theatre debut.

"Accor, the Paris-based operator of about 5,300 hotels globally, stated last week that hotel stays surpassed that of 2019 levels for the first time in Q2 across all regions and brands, including Mercure. “The enormous amount of American tourism [in Europe] is certainly an indication of our industry still being blessed with two things happening, the rebound of international travellers and a very, very strong domestic leisure market.” said Sébastien Bazin, chairman and CEO of Accor.
Last week, Skift released an online article going into detail about how Accor’s hotel stays have surpassed pre-COVID levels, which is an impressive feat. Mercure London Paddington is proud to be a part of the Accor family and we represent the brand as best we can, whilst adding our own individual twist as a part of London Town Hotels.
By the end of the second quarter, Accor’s prices moved above 2019 levels in several key markets. In London, the group’s hotel prices were up by 14%. Showing an increase from the previous three years sales figures and showing a resurgence in hotels stays, not only in London but across Europe also.
A strong pricing initiative assisted in the company’s quarterly lift in terms of worldwide REVPAR - revenue per available room, which is a key metric in the hospitality industry, by 1% above the level it had claimed in April through June of 2019.
“The hotels sector is getting support in particular from the excess savings built up by Western European and US consumers during the pandemic,” wrote Sabrina Blanc, a Societe Generale equity analyst for Accor. “Our main concern remains the ability of companies to pass on inflation to end customers concerns.” Yet inflation hasn’t yet weakened travel demand, Accor executives said.
Business travel usually accounts for around 60% of Accor’s business in the third quarter, however Mr. Bazin has been questioning how demand will change this year, if at all. However, it was noted that there are still some major worldwide events to take place throughout the remainder of the year which will boost leisure stays.
Accor has claimed that the marketing efforts put in place by the brand to avoid booking being taken by third party agents, such as online travel agents, has been successful in the first half of the year. Direct bookings through hotel channels have been on par with a mix of percentages from 2019. Being able to channel bookings directly through the hotel website helps the company and its partners, such as Mercure London Paddington, to avoid paying external fees to other distributors.
All in all, it is looking to be a positive outlook for the future for Accor and in turn the Mercure brand as a whole and we welcome this news as it means that travel is back. We have certainly missed having as many smiling faces walking through our doors and couldn’t be happier to welcome you all back as soon as possible.
If you’re planning a trip to London and are looking for a place to stay, then look no further than Mercure London Paddington for a lovely selection of rooms and customisable amenities to suit you. We are a two-minute walk from Paddington train station, which has easy access to the wonderful city of London and our knowledgeable staff can help you with any local enquiries you may have.

"Until The Flood
Theatre-lovers may be mourning the end of this year’s Edinburgh Fringe, but lucky Londoners have the chance to see the best of the summer’s shows. While the Fringe is crammed with shows of every calibre, only a very select few transfer to the capital, so you’re guaranteed exceptional quality.
Our autumn favourite is Until the Flood – winner of the Scotsman Fringe First Award and The Stage Edinburgh Award – which plays at the trendy Arcola Theatre from 4th to 28th September. In 2014, black teenager Michael Brown was shot and killed by white police officer Darren Wilson: this event, and the subsequent tidal wave of unrest that swept the nation, formed the springboard for Dael Orlandersmith’s challenging play, which explores racism in the United States. Pulitzer Prize finalist Orlandersmith is both author and actor in this one-woman show, and this powerful, provocative piece is based on real-life interviews that took place after the shooting.
The Arcola Theatre is an easy public transport journey away from us at the Mercure Paddington; and with tickets starting at just £10, a trip to Until The Flood is an absolute must this September.

"Celebrate Guy Fawkes in style
Autumn and Winter are filled with both festive and seasonal celebrations over the course of a few short months. One of the most popular celebrations in the United Kingdom is Guy Fawkes Night, aka Bonfire Night or Fireworks Night. November 5th has now become an evening of celebration and awe-inspiring displays of light that can be seen and heard all around the city of London and beyond.
It’s not uncommon for the United Kingdom to attract visitors from all over the globe to come and take part in the festivities of fireworks, sparklers and the like. The problem with the Guy Fawkes Night becoming such a popular event is that the market is now overly-saturated and now we’re spoilt for choice when deciding which display would be best to attend. We’ve put together a list of our top picks of Firework Displays and Bonfires so you can make an informed decision without too much leg work.
Alexandra Palace Fireworks Festival
The Alexandra Palace Fireworks Festival is, quite simply, one of the top displays in the city. Always bringing the best forms of entertainment including a well-known DJ and guest emcee’s (this year it’s Gok Wan); as well as having on hand delicious street food, a bonfire and a German Beer tent which will host a live Oompa band are just a few reasons that The Ally Pally festival is at the top of the celebrations list. Factor in that from Alexandra Palace you get a spectacular panoramic view of the city with the display, it really is a winning combination.
Barnes Bonfire Night
Barnes Bonfire Night is considered to be more of your ‘traditional’ 5th November celebration, there is a costume competition held annually for the ‘best guy’ dress up, the winner is then given the opportunity to ignite the bonfire which is done after the firework display. Street food vendors and a bar serving mulled wine and a selection of other beverages will be on site for all visitors to enjoy. This is a ticketed event and it is recommended that tickets are purchased in advance.
Battersea Park Fireworks
With the Battersea Power Station opening earlier this month it can be expected that this particular firework display will go all out. In fact due to it’s unparalleled success Wandsworth Council have secured to make the event this year a two-day extravaganza. Saturday 5th November sees the larger and louder fireworks display take place, this may not be suitable for younger children, Sunday 6th is your more family-friendly display which includes a virtual light display and a smaller fireworks display for the little ones to enjoy. Food and beverage stalls will be dotted around the area for visitors to enjoy.
Beckenham Fireworks
In a similar vein to Battersea Park Fireworks, Beckenham gives spectators the option of attending two different displays, the first display is more child-focused meaning less loud explosions and more colourful entertainment with the fuller display taking place later the same evening. Fun fair rides, hot food stalls and warm drinks stands can be expected to keep you warm.
If you’re planning on visiting London over this festive period of Guy Fawkes Night and need somewhere to stay then look no further than Mercure London Paddington with a lovely selection of rooms in London and customisable amenities you’ll receive the full 4* experience that you’ll need after braving the cold.

You then select the restaurant of your choosing, a pop up window will appear, in this window you will be able to reserve a table or, in some cases, join a waiting list if the restaurant is popular.
Planning a dinner night out with a large group can be a hassle, especially when you go at a busy hour. Google Maps can help you book a lunch or dinner reservation. Here's how.

"Something that never goes out of fashion and is probably one of the most entertaining and rejuvenating experiences is watching films! Ever since a few decades, watching films has been one of the most easiest ways to take a break and enjoy some place outside with a tub of popcorn with your family, your date, or even by yourself. 
The films that come out these days have an excellent production value and always aim at instilling ideas or giving the audience some kind of knowledge about a specific topic. Biographies have taken a rise and are directed with immense passion. Bohemian Rhapsody, released sometime in the late 2018 and was a world wide hit. The Merchant Square will be screening the Bohemian Rhapsody at an outdoor venue and it's an experience you cannot miss! 
Bohemian Rhapsody is a biographical film about Freddie Mercury, the lead singer of the British rock band Queen. It follows the singer's life from the formation of the band up to their 1985 performance at the original Wembley Stadium. It stars Rami Malek, as Freddie, who later won the Academy Award for best actor. 
The film was an absolute hit and the energy was electric. People were left in absolute awe of the music and performance in the film. You can now watch the Bohemian Rhapsody, for free, at the Merchant Square on the 7th of August. 
For absolute comfort, you can grab a deckchair, blanket and food from the local choice of street food vendors and settle down near the Grand Union Canal. The ambiance would be spectacular and the the feeling would be quite realistic.

"Summertime is gig time! People from all over the city look for new things to do and see. Chilling at the park, going to summer markets, digging into new cafes and restaurants is what we all wait for through the year. 
Thankfully, The London Busking Company has decided to pour us in with free gigs as part of the Summer of Fun Programme of events! The gorgeous Lucy May Walker will be performing at the Floating Pocket Park at the beautiful outdoor venue where deckchairs and blankets will be provided for you to have a comfortable experience. 
After Lucy May Walker graduated from the University of Cumbria with a 1st class honours degree in performing arts, she decided to take a step away from theatre and concentrate solely on music. She is a folk-pop Singer/Songwriter originally from Worcestershire, now based in London. 
Her EP, Heartbreak Songs, reached no. 3 on the iTunes Singer/Songwriter chart, receiving a number of plays on BBC Introducing across the country. The title track, Heartbreak Song, was played on Jeremy Vine's BBC Radio 2 show after he spotted her busking around in London. 
Lucy has had a number of live gigs around the country and has joined some with well known artists on stage. Her Sofar sessions have lured a number of people to come and watch her perform live. It's said that her music brings about a different kind of feeling in the audience. She feels what she performs and writes and that's probably one of the most important factors people look for in musicians these days. 
On Thursday 29th August head on down to the most unique outdoor venue in London, the Floating Pocket Park on the Grand Union canal, Paddington Basin.

"In association with Merchant Square and Paddington Central, people from all over the area will come together for this friendly competition to help raise money for the local Children of St Mary’s Intensive Care [COSMIC] charity. The much-needed funds will go towards helping support the families of children being treated on the ward. Last year, over £16,000 was raised for COSMIC and event organisers would love to beat that total this year. 
The sport itself has a 2,000-year-old Chinese legacy, with each boat holding 10 rowers and 1 drummer to help the crew maintain their rhythm. With prizes including ‘Best Dressed’ and ‘Fastest Team’, it’s a great day out for all the family to watch 20 boats race over five heats and cheer on all the volunteers taking part – many in fancy dress.
In addition, the popular Rubber Duck Race will also be taking place on the same day. Starting at 12:30 around 500 rubber ducks will be launched onto the Regent’s Canal at St. Mary’s Bridge where they will bob 100 metres to the finish line by the Paddington Water Taxi launch point.

"Buckingham Palace is one of the few remaining working royal palaces in the world: home of the Queen, it is internationally renowned as the focus of national and royal celebrations, and of course as a backdrop for the Changing of the Guard ceremony. For the last 20 years, Buckingham Palace has thrown open its doors for 10 weeks over the summer, and this year is no different: from 20th July to 29th September, visitors can step inside this historic, world-famous palace and experience its grandeur for themselves.
With over 775 rooms – including 78 bathrooms – your visit certainly won’t disappoint! One of the highlights is the opportunity to explore the 19 State Rooms – a suite of extravagantly decorated public rooms, where the Queen receives and entertains her subjects and visiting officials. Many of these rooms were used during William and Kate’s wedding reception, and are lavishly decorated with glittering candelabra, some of the finest English and French furniture in the world, luxurious carpets, marble columns, and impressive works of art.
The Grand Staircase is another highlight: this arresting, bronze staircase was intricately designed by architect John Nash, and looks particularly impressive lit by a carved glass dome in the ceiling. Art-lovers will marvel at paintings by Rembrandt, Rubens and Poussin, and sculpture by Canova and Chantrey; don’t miss the imposing, majestic Throne Room, used in ceremonial receptions and forming the backdrop to the Royal Wedding photos; and enjoy being shown around by Prince Charles, the voice of your free audio guide!
Each year, there are special exhibitions as part of the palace’s summer opening, and this year’s are particularly noteworthy: 2019 marks 200 years since Queen Victoria’s birth, so visitors can enjoy an exhibition demonstrating how young Queen Victoria transformed the palace from a private house into a working royal residence. 2019 also marks the 500th anniversary of Leonardo da Vinci’s death, so a second exhibition displays more than 200 of his greatest drawings in the Royal Collection – the largest exhibition of da Vinci’s work in over 65 years. Although its doors are open for a full 10 weeks, Buckingham Palace’s summer opening is extremely popular, so make sure to book in advance.
Buckingham Palace is located two miles away from us at the Mercure Paddington – easily accessible by public transport, or, on a fine day, a beautiful walk through the city’s finest parks. Once you’ve absorbed as much royalty as you can manage, enjoy a leisurely stroll back to us through some of London’s lushest greenery.

"For the last 10 years, Paddington Basin Canal has been home to the summer Dragon Boat Race. Once again this year, on Thursday 25th July, fearless crews will take to the water to compete to be awarded Fastest Team, Runner-Up Team, and the highly coveted Best Dressed Team – all in aid of local charity COSMIC, Children of St Mary’s Intensive Care, which overlooks Paddington Basin.
This colourful competition is a fun, friendly spectacle not to be missed! Each boat contains eleven competitors – ten paddlers and one drummer – who race their way along Merchant Square Canal in a determined effort to be first to cross the finish line. Crews are comprised of people from across Paddington – work colleagues, groups of family and friends – all coming together to raise money for an essential cause. Last year raised an impressive £16,000 for COSMIC, helping them to help hundreds of critically ill children from across the capital. 
The fun kicks off at 5pm, with races continuing until 9pm; but with so much surrounding the events, make sure to leave plenty of time to enjoy the excitement! Pick up a scrumptious bite to eat or a trendy craft beer from one of the numerous eateries; take time to stroll around Paddington’s gorgeous Floating Pocket Park; or join in with the festivities by dressing up for the occasion!
Located just minutes from Paddington Basin, the Mercure Paddington is the perfect place to stay to enjoy the excitement! Book now and look forward to an idyllic summer’s evening.

"Rachel Whiteread
It’s what’s on the inside that counts, at least that’s what my mum says. Rachel Whiteread must have been told the same thing growing up, because the influential British sculptor (and first female winner of the Turner Prize back in 1993) is singularly obsessed with the inside of objects. Over a 25-year career, she has managed to create a powerful, defined, unique aesthetic by disregarding the outside of things and instead examining the emptiness within, often to devastatingly emotional effect. 
You walk into this show at Tate Britain in London to be confronted by a city turned to ash. The early works are casts of the negative space of a fireplace, a bath, a closet, a hot-water bottle; it looks like the fossilised remains of the entire contents of a lost home.

Considered to be royalty amongst London pubs, The Grenadier Pub is a landmark in it’s own right. This hidden gem of a pub can be found in Belgrave Square and is loved by locals and visitors alike.
Established in 1720 the pub was originally kept exclusively for the use by the senior infantry of the British Army and didn’t open its doors to the public until 1818. There is a legend that comes with this pub, it is said that the Grenadier itself was named after a young soldier by the name of Cedric who was a soldier who was reprimanded by other locals when he was caught cheating at a card game. No one knows exactly when this ghastly deed occurred, but it is thought to have been in September as that is when ghostly happenings are rife. Visitors hang money from the ceiling in an attempt to pay his debt, but poor Cedric seems to remain trapped on earth.
Spooky hauntings aside, The Grenadier is known for its outstanding traditional cuisine ranging from roasted duck breast to a mouth-watering beef wellington.

"Spanning nearly fifty seven acres St. James’ Park includes several tourist landmarks including: The Mall; a grand processional route which honours Queen Victoria. The Mall has been at the forefront of many a Royal procession, these incorporate coronations, state openings of Parliament and state visits.
The Horse Guards Parade; which is where the Trooping the Colour takes place every year to mark the official birthday of the British Sovereign for over 260 years, is the official entrance to St James’ Park and Buckingham Palace. The Horse Guards is the central building with a clock tower and archway and it dates back to the eighteenth century and was designed by William Kent, who was the Chief Architect to George II at the time.
The building is guarded by two mounted cavalry troopers of The Queen's Life Guard who are posted outside from 10am to 4pm daily. The Life Guard change takes place here at 11:00am daily and 10:00am on Sundays.
Once you’re done having a wonder around the stunning park you are able to enjoy a glorious rest stop at St. James’ Café. This quaint café is surrounded by a rich abundance of flora and fauna, you will also be able to experience stunning views of the fountain and lake from the contemporary roof terrace, external seating areas or looking through the panoramic floor-to-ceiling windows.

"Richmond Park is the largest Royal Park in London covering an area of 2,500 acres. From its heights there is an uninterrupted view of St Paul's Cathedral, 12 miles away.
Over the centuries very little has changed in Richmond Park, even though it is enclosed by human habitation the grasslands, woodland gardens and various landscapes of hills remains untouched and still houses several different species of wildlife.
Richmond Park has plenty of different activities that you are able to take part in and also it has stunning sights for all to see.
The Isabella Plantation is a stunning woodland garden that was planted in the 1830’s it is hidden within a Victorian woodland plantation, it is most commonly known for its evergreen azaleas which surround the ponds and streams and are usually visible in spring between April and May.
King Henry’s Mound is located within Pembroke Lodge Gardens and was originally a burial chamber that is now utilised by visitors as a viewpoint for hunting, due to the steepness of the mound the view is certainly not one to miss.
Whilst you’re visiting Pembroke Lodge don’t forget to look out for the Ian Drury bench which is situated in Poet’s Corner, the bench was placed in memory of the rock star who used to take his children to Richmond Park regularly.

"£14.8m Crossrail project running through Paddington nears completion
According to an announcement delivered by the Department of Transport last month, Crossrail – Europe’s biggest infrastructure project – is now in its final stages, with 93% of the project said to be complete.
Having entered its critical testing and commissioning stage, and with trains currently being tested between Abbey Ward and Canary Wharf as well as in other unopened tunnels – the Elizabeth line is set to be ready for its December 2018 launch.
As well as transforming travel by making journeys quicker, easier and more accessible through London, this new line will make Paddington a central hub of commercial significance. It is estimated that the new line will bring 1.5 million more people into London, and hundreds of thousands are expected to use it every day.
Mercure London Paddington is one of the hotels on the very doorstep of this huge new venture, and looks forward to welcoming travelers from across the city and country."

"Less than twenty minutes from our doorstep are the awe-inspiring Handel and Hendrix house, separated by one wall and two hundred years, these two artists decided to make Mayfair their homes whilst they both changed the face of music forever in their respective genres.
Initially beginning as The Handel House Trust, the idea of restoring Handel’s house back to it’s former glory dates back to 1959 by musicologist Stanley Sadie, due to a long list of reasons it took longer than expected to get the logistics organised and The Handel House Museum didn’t become open to the public until 8 November 2001.
The Handel House Trust procured a near one thousand year lease in 2007 for the entirety of 25 Brook Street, this then enabled a two stage Master Plan to be developed to restore both Jimi Hendrix’s flat on the upper floor of 23 Brook Street and the ground floor and basement of Handel’s house next door as 25 Brook Street respectively. As the first phase of the Master Plan a new studio space, extended lift access to all floors and additional visitor facilities were developed and opened in February 2016.
The second phase of the Master Plan is now underway, meaning that the Museum is currently closed but it expected to reopen in Spring 2023!
